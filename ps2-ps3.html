                <h2>PlayStation 2</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>The PlayStation 2 (PS2) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer
                        Entertainment. It was first released in Japan on 4 March 2000, in North America on 26 October
                        2000,
                        in
                        Europe on 24 November 2000, and in Australia on 30 November 2000. It is the successor to the
                        original
                        PlayStation, as well as the second installment in the PlayStation brand of consoles. As a
                        sixth-generation console, it competed with Sega's Dreamcast, Nintendo's GameCube, and
                        Microsoft's
                        Xbox.
                    </p>
                    <p>Announced in 1999, Sony began developing the console after the immense success of its
                        predecessor.
                        The
                        PS2 offered backward-compatibility for its predecessor's DualShock controller, as well as its
                        games.
                    </p>

                    <p>The PlayStation 2 received widespread critical acclaim upon release, and is the best-selling
                        video
                        game
                        console of all time, having sold over 155 million units worldwide. A total of 4,000 game titles
                        were
                        released, with over 1.5 billion copies sold. In 2004, Sony released a smaller, lighter revision
                        of
                        the console known as the PS2 Slim. Even after the release of its successor, the PlayStation 3,
                        it
                        remained popular well into the seventh generation. It continued to be produced until 2013 when
                        Sony
                        finally announced that it had been discontinued after over twelve years of production, one of
                        the
                        longest lifespans of any video game console. New games for the console continued to be made
                        until
                        the
                        end of its life.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The PlayStation 3 (PS3) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment.
                        The
                        successor to the PlayStation 2, it is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles. It was first
                        released
                        on November 11, 2006, in Japan, November 17, 2006, in North America, and March 23, 2007, in
                        Europe
                        and Australia. The PlayStation 3 competed primarily against Microsoft's Xbox 360 and
                        Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles.</p>
                    <p>
                        During its early years, the system received a mixed reception, due to its high price ($599 for a
                        60-gigabyte model, $499 for a 20 GB model), a complex processor architecture, and lack of
                        quality
                        games
                        but was praised for its Blu-ray capabilities and "untapped potential". The reception would get
                        more
                        positive over time. The system had a slow start in the market but managed to recover,
                        particularly
                        after the introduction of the Slim model. Its successor, the PlayStation 4, was released later
                        in
                        November 2013. On September 29, 2015, Sony confirmed that sales of the PlayStation 3 were to be
                        discontinued in New Zealand, but the system remained in production in other markets.Shipments of
                        new units to Europe and Australia ended in March 2016, followed by North America which ended in
                        October
                        2016.Heading into 2017, Japan was the last territory where new units were still being produced
                        until May 29, 2017, when Sony confirmed the PlayStation 3 was discontinued in Japan.
