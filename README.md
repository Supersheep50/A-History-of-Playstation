[View live project here](https://supersheep50.github.io/A-History-of-Playstation/)

This website is designed to be an informational resource for PlayStation fans and newcomers alike. The site will be aimed at gamers and other folks who would love to learn more about the history of the PlayStation console as it quickly approaches its 30th anniversary. The website will chronicle each variation of the console and how it has changed over the years, from the PlayStation right up to the PlayStation 5.

Each section will also include some examples of the best selling games for each generation.

-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        - The idea behind the colour scheme was to include as many of the prime Playstation logo colours as possible. I found the navy contrasted well against the black of the header background and the PS logo itself. The main colours I used were black, navy, white, yellow and red. I wanted to create a website that was easy to read and navigate.

    -   #### Typography
        - Ubuntu and Sans-serif were chosen as I felt they had a videogame feel to them. Similar to the type of font you'd find in many modern videogames today. They felt close to the font used by PlayStation on many of their own websites. 

    -   #### Imagery
        -  The header that was chosen is an iconic image of the PS logo on a black backdrop. The logo instills a particular sense of nostalgia for me and hopefully visitors to the site. I have also added photos of each of the consoles and their normal (not slim) versions. This gives users a better idea of what the info text is talking about, especially if they are not familiar with the consoles. Images have also been added to each of the best selling games for each console. I've used the cover art for the games as they add a great deal of colour to the website.

### Known Bugs (Resolved)
- The WC3 Validator reported back several bugs that I resolved: 
    1. Articles lacking heading on each of the pages. 
    2. End div tag on line 128 had no closing bracket. 
    3. Unclosed Element form on line 114 for index.html. 
- PlayStation console images appeared stretched when testing on mobile. Width had been set to auto for the div the image was in and this was causing issues.
- Originally had used float to position images. This caused major issues when it came to responivesness. Decided to use flex and re-write code. 
- Images were of different sizes and the zoom effect was causing them to stretch off of the page. Resized images and used flex to position correctly.
