                    <h2>PlayStation 4</h2>
                    <p>The PlayStation 4 (PS4) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment.
                        Announced
                        as the successor to the PlayStation 3 in February 2013, it was launched on November 15, 2013, in
                        North
                        America, November 29, 2013 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in
                        Japan. A
                        console of the eighth generation, it competes with Microsoft's Xbox One and Nintendo's Wii U and
                        Switch.

                        <p>Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console
                            features
                            an
                            AMD
                            Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can
                            theoretically
                            peak
                            at
                            1.84 teraflops; AMD stated that it was the "most powerful" APU it had developed to date. The
                            PlayStation
                            4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and
                            services,
                            including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported
                            devices
                            ("Remote
                            Play"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay
                            remotely
                            ("Share Play"). The console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the
                            PlayStation
                            3,
                            with
                            improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The
                            console
                            also
                            supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia.</p>

                    <h2>PlayStation 5</h2>
                    <p>
                        The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive
                        Entertainment. Announced in 2019 as the successor to the PlayStation 4, the PS5 was released on
                        November 12,
                        2020,
                        in
                        Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, with worldwide release following
                        a
                        week
                        later. The PS5 is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles, along with Microsoft's
                        Xbox
                        Series X and Series S consoles, which were released in the same month.</p>

                    <p>The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The
                        Digital
                        Edition lacks this drive, allowing it to serve as a lower-cost model for those who prefer to
                        buy
                        games
                        through digital download. The two variants were launched simultaneously.</p>

                    <p>The PlayStation 5's main hardware features include a solid-state drive customized for
                        high-speed
                        data
                        streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of
                        4K
                        resolution
                        display at up to 120 frames per second, hardware-accelerated ray tracing for realistic
                        lighting
                        and
                        reflections, and the Tempest Engine allowing for hardware-accelerated 3D audio effects.
                        Other
                        features
                        include the DualSense controller with haptic feedback and backward compatibility with the
                        majority
                        of PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games.</p>
