            <h2>PlayStation 4</h2>
            <p>The PlayStation 4 (PS4) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. Announced
                as the successor to the PlayStation 3 in February 2013, it was launched on November 15, 2013, in North
                America, November 29, 2013 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in Japan. A
                console of the eighth generation, it competes with Microsoft's Xbox One and Nintendo's Wii U and Switch.

                <p>Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console features an
                    AMD
                    Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak
                    at
                    1.84 teraflops; AMD stated that it was the "most powerful" APU it had developed to date. The
                    PlayStation
                    4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and
                    services,
                    including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices
                    ("Remote
                    Play"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely
                    ("Share Play"). The console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3,
                    with
                    improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The console also
                    supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia.</p>

            <h2>PlayStation 2</h2>
            <p>The PlayStation 2 (PS2) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer
                Entertainment. It was first released in Japan on 4 March 2000, in North America on 26 October 2000, in
                Europe on 24 November 2000, and in Australia on 30 November 2000. It is the successor to the original
                PlayStation, as well as the second installment in the PlayStation brand of consoles. As a
                sixth-generation console, it competed with Sega's Dreamcast, Nintendo's GameCube, and Microsoft's Xbox.
            </p>
            <p>Announced in 1999, Sony began developing the console after the immense success of its predecessor. The
                PS2 offered backward-compatibility for its predecessor's DualShock controller, as well as its games.</p>

            <p>The PlayStation 2 received widespread critical acclaim upon release, and is the best-selling video game
                console of all time, having sold over 155 million units worldwide. A total of 4,000 game titles were
                released, with over 1.5 billion copies sold. In 2004, Sony released a smaller, lighter revision of
                the console known as the PS2 Slim. Even after the release of its successor, the PlayStation 3, it
                remained popular well into the seventh generation. It continued to be produced until 2013 when Sony
                finally announced that it had been discontinued after over twelve years of production, one of the
                longest lifespans of any video game console. New games for the console continued to be made until the
                end of its life.</p>
