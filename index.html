            <h2>PlayStation 1</h2>
            <p>The PlayStation[a] (abbreviated as PS, commonly known as the PS1 or its codename PSX) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. 
                It was released in Japan on 3 December 1994, in North America on 9 September 1995, in Europe on 29 September 1995, and in Australia on 15 November 1995. 
                As a fifth-generation console, the PlayStation primarily contended with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn.</p>
                <p>The console proved popular for its extensive game library, popular franchises, low retail price, and aggressive youth marketing which advertised it as the preferable console for adolescents and adults. 
                    Premier PlayStation franchises included Gran Turismo, Crash Bandicoot, Tomb Raider, and Final Fantasy, all of which spawned numerous sequels. 
                    PlayStation games continued to sell until Sony ceased production of the PlayStation and its games on 23 March 2006â€”over eleven years after it had been released, and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3. 
                    A total of 3,061 PlayStation games were released, with cumulative sales of 967 million units.</p>
